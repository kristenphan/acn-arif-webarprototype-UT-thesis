# WebAR Prototype + AR Implementation Framework
## INTRODUCTION
This repository stores the outputs of Kristen Phan's internship (kristen.phan@accenture.com):
1. WebAR prototype: AR running directly in a web browser; deployed on an AWS serverless architecture; helps monitor the health of houseplant through the use of an AR dashboard with real-time data from soil moisture sensor and watering history records.
2. AR Implementation Framework: guides the design and implementation of AR solutions so that ACN can deliver many AR solutions to come, not just a single WebAR prototype that Kristen's built; View ```./AR-implementation-framework-presentation-slides``` for details on the framework.

## HOW TO DEPLOY THE APPLICATION?
1. Create an AWS account and IAM user profile
2. Attach the following permissions to the user profile - see Appendix A
3. Create [access key Id and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) for the user profile
4. Create an AWS service connection called "aws-sc" as referenced in ```./azure-pipelines.yml``` in Azure DevOps console to allow Azure DevOps to connect to AWS
5. Push the code to Azure DevOps Repository
5. Create a new Pipeline in Azure DevOps Pipelines by referencing ```./azure-pipelines.yml```
6. Run the pipeline manually from Azure DevOps Pipelines console. Or the pipeline is auto triggered with a new commit.
7. The deployed application runs on all major browsers (best on iOS Safari/ Chrome). When running the application in a browser, point the device at the image marker. An AR dashboard for monitoring the health of houseplant will be rendered on top of the image marker. 

## PROTOTYPE SERVERLESS ARCHITECTURE
1. Tracking engine: implements image tracking technique by [MindAR](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/). The image marker can be found in ```./frontend/assets/targets/acn.png```. The image marker is compiled using [MindAR's compiler](https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/quick-start/compile) and can be found in ```./frontend/assets/targets/acn.mind```.

2. Rendering engine: implements [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
3. Hand gesture recognition: implements [Tensorflow's pre-trained fingerpose model](https://github.com/andypotato/fingerpose) for thumbs-up and thumbs-down gestures.
4. Build tools: [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for concatenating all .JS files into a single .JS file; [babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpiling code so that older browsers can understand; [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) as package manager since it was easier to install a dependency for Tensorflow fingerpose model using yarn than using npm; [AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-command-reference.html) is used to deploy SAM/ CloudFormation template for deploying AWS resources.  
5. Moisture sensor and microcontroler: a physical houseplant is fitted with a generic moisture sensor and an [ESP32 microcontroller](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32). The sensor and the microcontroller are configured using [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/) - see code in ```./backend/arduino-esp32```.   
6. Frontend: consists of S3 frontend bucket + CloudFront distribution; The tracking, rendering, and Tensorflow all run in browser. 
7. Backend: consists of Lambda + DDB + IoT
8. S3: 2 buckets - one bucket storing the build artifacts generated by Azure DevOps Pipelines, another bucket storing the frontend's static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, and media). The S3 frontend bucket is not publicly facing and only accepts traffic from the CloudFront distribution.
9. CloudFront: sits in front of S3; queries static contents from S3 frontend bucket and serves them to browser via HTTPS since most browsers require HTTPS in order to access webcam when running the AR application.
10. Lambda: public facing but accept only CloudFront Distribution endpoint as the origin. Write and read traffic are isolated to allow lambda to scale independently. 
11. DynamoDB: time-to-live is configured to auto expire sensor data more than 30 days old;
12. IoT: register sensor device and create a device certificate which should be included in the ```./backend/arduino-esp32/secrets.h``` (Note that ```secrets.h``` is not tracked by Git for security purposes). Using the device certificate, the microcontroller authenticates and publish sensor data to IoT Core every 5 seconds. IoT Core then writes all sensor data arrived at the specified MQTT message queue to ddb. 
13. CloudFormation: Use SAM/ CloudFormation templates to deploy the frontend and backend resources on AWS.
14. Azure DevOps: store source code in Azure DevOps Repository and execute CI/CD pipeline defined in ```./azure-pipelines.yml``` in Azure DevOps Pipelines. In ```./azure-pipelines.yaml```, SAM CLI commands and others are executed to build and deploy the frontend and backend to AWS.

## LIMITATIONS
1. IAM permissions in Appendix A should be restricted for S3, IoT, and CloudFront. Full access was given during development because of time constraints. 
2. Lambda functions are publicly accessible but are configured with a CORS policy to accept only traffic from CloudFront's CDN endpoint. As new lambda functions are created with new lambda function URLs, the lambda function URLs need to be updated accordingly in ```./frontend/.env``` so that the frontend can invoke the lambdas at their new function URLs.
